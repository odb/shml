  An overview of SHML, how to download, install and use, syntax overview with examples.
</p>

To use SHML you must have unix-like (Darwin/OS X, Linux, etc.) POSIX-compliant operating system that supports ANSI/VT100 Control Sequences.  If you are using an up to date version of OS X or any Linux distribution you should be good to go.  If you run into issues please [report it here](https://github.com/MaxCDN/shml/issues).
